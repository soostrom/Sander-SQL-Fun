As a portfolio, I'm using this file to guide your through the development process. 

First of all, typically there should be a work intake meeting where requirements are being discussed and validated. Once prioritised, 

On a high-level the technical steps were: 
  1. Create DB: Created a local PostgreSQL database  
  2. ETL: Ingested commonly used 'Northwind' data set from Microsoft to populate the database
  3. Analyses: CTE based SQL query and transform data
  4. Version control: Commit SQL query to Github repo
  5. Visualisation: Create Tableau Public Dashboard based on dataset

Tableau Public link will be pasted here
