As a portfolio, I'm using this file to guide your through the development process. 

First of all, typically there should be a work intake meeting where requirements are being discussed and validated. Once the business question is clarified and the correct KPI's are defined, the request will be prioritised and planned. Below I'm walking through the development process for this particular data product.

On a high-level the technical steps were: 
  1. Create DB: Created a local PostgreSQL database  
  2. ETL: Ingested commonly used 'Northwind' sample data set from Microsoft to populate the database
  3. Analyses: CTE based SQL query with data transformations
  4. Version control: Commit SQL query to Github repo
  5. Visualisation: Create Tableau Public Dashboard based on dataset (used CSV available in Github as datasource due to limited Tableau Public connections)


Tableau Public link will be pasted here
